# Sprint 1 Planning meeting
## Participants, Sprint Goals, Spikes
In our Sprint 1 planning meeting, the group Drop Table Teams (consisting of Jan, Christina, Anika, Jiale, Kourosh, Mohammed, and Raymond) decided that our sprint goal was to have a home page and a dashboard, where users could view their profiles and job listings. This sprint does not contain any spikes since we are working with basic MERN stack implementation.

## User stories

- As any user, I want to log into the website so that I can access site content. (User login, 4 points) (DTT-4)
- As any user, I want to create an account so that I can make a profile on the platform. (User signup, 4 points) (DTT-1)
- As any user, I want to log out of my profile so that I can safeguard my information. (User log out, 4 points)  (DTT-7) 
- As a job-seeker, I want to view available jobs so that I can find suitable jobs to which I can apply. (View job listing, 4 points) (DTT-21)
- As any user, I want to customize my profile so that I can appeal to employers. (Profile customization, 9 points) (DTT-5)
- As an employer, I want to post jobs on the platform so that I can attract applicants for the position I am hiring for. (Post job listing, 6 points) (DTT-20)
