# Release Planning Meeting
## Release goal
Our release goal is to have a website that allows users to access the website and create an account. With their account, users can connect and chat with one another. For users who are job seekers, they will be able to view jobs, attend job fairs, create a 90-second elevator pitch, and use our web extension to autofill external job applications on third-party websites. For users who are recruiters, they will be able to schedule interviews/set reminders, rank elevator pitches, create job postings, host fairs, view job applications, and elevator pitches.

## Scope
### Sprint 1
* DTT-1, DTT-4, DTT-7, DTT-20, DTT-5, DTT-21, DTT-8

Job seekers are able to create/upload a 90-second elevator pitch video which they can submit along with their resume and other documents to job applications on the site.
