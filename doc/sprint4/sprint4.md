# Sprint 4 Planning meeting

## Participants, Sprint Goals, Spikes

In our Sprint 4 planning meeting, the group Drop Table Teams (consisting of Jan, Christina, Anika, Jiale, Kourosh, Mohammed, and Raymond) decided that our sprint goal will be to implement the bulk of our remaining user stories and to improve frontend design. These user stories include the ability of an employer to view elevator pitches, and job seekers to be able to apply for any job they wish to. The other features to be implemented are the notifications to be real-time on the website, the web extension feature would be able to autofill job applications on our website, schedule meetings with a specific applicant, search for specific jobs, the ability of employers to view all the applications to a job they have posted, attend a job fair, and view profiles of other users. There was one spike in this sprint and it was integrating the video conferencing feature using a third-party API. The team members assigned these tasks collaboratively, researched and reviewed documentation to further their knowledge which aided with implementation. These features were broken down into multiple sub-tasks to aid in completing them.
