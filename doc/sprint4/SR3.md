---
### Participants:
- Anika Sultana
- Jiale (Sandy) Shang
- Jan Miguel Marchan
- Mohammad Rahman
- Kourosh Jaberi
- Raymond Kiguru
- Christina Ma

### Unfinished tasks and group them into stories:
- DTT-100: Employers can view the applications.
- DTT-99: Employers can schedule interviews with specific users
- DTT-101: Employers can view elevator pitches
- DTT-106: Users can schedule Zoom meetings
- DTT-107: Notifications are real time
- DTT-108: Extension autofill feature can be used on Easy App-ly itself

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Continue having our standup meetings every couple days. This helps keep everyone on track and all members updated on everyone else’s progress.
- Dividing the required deliverable early on amongst team members ensured all deliverables were completed and done well.
- Continue to immediately divide tasks and user stories at the start of the sprint, which allows all members more time to work on their tasks.
- Complete a quick run-through before our demo with our TA to ensure no errors pop up

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Include the task number in all commit messages
- Not to wait until the last day to merge all code pieces together. This process took many hours as we didn’t anticipate to run into as many merging issues as we did.
- Not testing all PR thoroughly before approving a merge with the main branch. 

### What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 3:
Best: 
- Our demo went smoothly.
- New features were successfully implemented and showcased successfully.
- Attendance for all our meetings and standups were perfect. The standups ran smoothly.

Worst: 
- Some required deliverables ended up taking much longer to complete than expected due to dependencies on show work products still being worked on close to the deadline.
- Code merging took longer than usual since every new merge led to merge conflicts for other pull requests.
