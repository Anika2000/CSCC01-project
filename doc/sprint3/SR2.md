### Unfinished tasks and group them into stories:
DTT-84: As an employer, I want to view and have access to the 90 second elevator pitches of job applicants so that I can find evaluate potential employees.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Continue to have the user stories that are more complex and have more subtasks split amongst multiple team members. 
- Continue to begin working on the assigned tasks early to allow for team members working on the same user story to help each other when one team member runs into an issue. 
- Continue having our standup meetings every few days. This helps keep everyone on track and all members updated on everyone elseâ€™s progress.
- Having all members prepare their standup messages in advance so that the meetings run much quicker.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Divide the work to complete the necessary documentation early on. 
- Having branch names without the Jira task number.
- Include the task number in all commit messages.
- Complete a quick run-through before our demo with our TA to ensure no errors pop up.
- Not testing all PR thoroughly before approving merge with main branch.

### What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 2:
Best: 
- All work was completed with little to no conflicts. Everyone contributed meaningfully and were cooperative. 
- Attendance for all our meetings and standups were perfect. Our meetings run much quicker than in previous sprints.
- The merging of our code went much quicker than last sprint
Worst: 
- An error popped up during our demo.
- Making sure all required documents were completed ended up taking much longer than expected.
