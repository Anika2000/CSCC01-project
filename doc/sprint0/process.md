# Process

## How did you organize the team?

At the beginning of the team formation, we jointly agreed on a team contract and organized the team based on this.

In terms of assigning tasks/roles, according to the team contract:

> We will divide work evenly on a volunteer basis at the start of each sprint: that is, for each task (feature, document, etc), team members will choose the tasks that they want to work on. If there are conflicts about multiple people who want to work on the same task, we will first decide by team vote, choosing based on prior experience. Otherwise, weâ€™ll choose randomly.

In this sprint0:

| Member          | Task                                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mohammad Rahman | Backend Setup, [Product backlog](pb.md), [`done.md`](done.md)                        |
| Jan Marchan     | [`team-contract.pdf`](team-contract.pdf), User Experience, Frontend Setup            |
| Christina Ma    | [`competition.md`](competition.md), [`done.md`](done.md)                             |
| Kourosh Jaberi  | [Product backlog](pb.md)                                                             |
| Jiale Shang     | [`process.md`](process.md)                                                           |
| Anika Sultana   | [`summary.md`](summary.md), [`personas.pdf`](personas.pdf), [Product backlog](pb.md) |
| Raymond Kiguru  | [`README.md`](README.md), Database Setup                                             |

## Which tools did you use, if any?

- We used Discord for communication, meetings, and sharing project-related materials.
- We used Zoom for meeting with startup teams.
- We used Google Docs to share and edit team documents.
- We used Figma to design the user interface.
- We used GitHub for tracking status and compiling changes.

## How did you make decisions?

When a decision is to be made, we will discuss it in a meeting where members brainstorm and exchange ideas. We will decide by voting and follow the majority. 


If the vote is too close(3:4) or there are disagreements, we will reach out to the project owner, TAs, or the professor and do more research on the topic.

After getting suggestions and more information from the outside, we will again discuss and vote in the team.

We will repeat this process until most people (at least 5) agree.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?

Regarding the "prioritizing PB" part of lecture 2, we defined the priority based on value, cost, risk, and knowledge.

The highest priority was given to the basic expectations as mentioned in the Kano model, followed by the core features (elevator pitch, chrome extension, and virtual interviews) expected by the startup team. 

Then we analyzed the costs and benefits to rank the remaining user stories and prioritized those features that take fewer investments to delight users.

We decided to implement the features that are neither expected nor critical, but can improve the user experience last.

## How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

Usually, we will reach an agreement through discussion. If there is a need to vote, we will decide the point based on 1 to 2 rounds of voting.

## How frequently did you meet?

Generally, we meet on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays at 6 pm (roughly 30mins each) and have a project demo with TA on Tuesday during 5-7 pm.

For sprint 0, we had:

 - Two meetings (9.10 and 9.15) to set up our team;
 - One meeting (9.17) to make a preliminary discussion on project topics;
 - Two meetings with the Being Seen team(10 am 9.18) and Reggie (6 pm 9.18) for more information on core features, mockups, and stakeholders;
 - One meeting (right after the meeting with Reggie) to decide Early Apply as the project topic by votes and to assign sprint0 tasks;
 - Several meetings (9.20, 9.22, 9.24) to check in with the team and address any issues we might be facing.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

We learned that it is essential to start early to have more time to perfect our work. 

We learned that we should complete as many tasks assigned in the last meeting and prepare topics to be discussed before a new meeting to make things more efficient.

We also learned that active communication within the team could help us know whether everyone is working well. When we face obstacles, we should not hesitate to reach out to our team, TAs, or anyone we think helps.

For the next phase, we will ensure that our meetings are organized and efficient. We will make sure that every team member is on the same page and is clear on all the criteria and their work.
