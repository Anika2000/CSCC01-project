## Defintion of "Done" for a User Story

The definition of “done” for a user story is when the feature has been implemented and is fully functional. The implemented feature must satisfy its corresponding user story. The feature must receive confirmation from the client that the feature implemented satisfies the corresponding user story. The implemented feature must have passed all tests and does not contain any significant defects that would impact the feature’s functionality on the website.

“Significant defects” is defined as bugs/issues that lead to the feature failing to function or does not function as intended, and is within the team’s capability to fix. An example of a “significant defect” for the elevator pitch feature is if users are unable to view or upload the elevator pitch videos. This issue results in the elevator pitch feature failing to function and is within the team’s capability to resolve this issue, therefore the corresponding user story for this feature is considered not “done.” 

## Defintion of "Done" for the Entire Project

The definition of “done” for the entire project is when all features required for the minimum viable product (MVP) for Easy App-ly have been implemented and are fully functional. Features for the MVP include:
- able to upload and view elevator pitch videos
- have a web extension that will pre-populate fields on online job application forms on third party websites
- able to facilitate and schedule online job interviews 
- able to create and view profiles 
- able to post job postings and users can apply to these job postings

The completed project may include additional features beyond what is outlined for the MVP, however this is not a requirement for the project to be considered “done.”
