# Drop Tables Team : Summary of Project (Easy App-ly)

## Project Objective

The **objective** is to develop a web application that speed up both the job searching process for job seekers and the talent acquisition process for recruiters. A key feature of the application is allowing job seekers to create a short 1-2 minute elevator pitch video that will be used by recruiters to quickly shortlist potential candidates by boosting their profile. The application will allow recruiters to host virtual job fairs, video interviews, and to attract the best talents on the platform. The application will extend beyond its job portal to be a plug-in for other third party websites, such as company career sites, where it would pre-populate the application form fields for applicants.     

## Key users and Scenarios

**Recruiter B** works for a mid-tier software company called X-Y-Z and is searching for potential candidates to fill a software intern role at his company. He has received some applications but is not impressed by any of them. He is having a diffciult time getting through the mountain of applications that look like a copy and paste of the same resume. He signs up to our website by providing a valid username/email and password, and posts his job opening on our job board. He also sees the job fair feature and decides to host a virtual job fair hoping it will attract the best candidates. Student A sees this job fair and decides to attend it. 

**Student A** is an incoming sophomore at the University of Toronto, majoring in Computer Science. He has finished first year successfully and is ready to utilize his knowledge by landing an internship. Aside from applying to various internships, he is also enrolled in full time studies. Student A is having a difficult time navigating through different websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Workday to fill up different types of application forms for various companies. Student A is short on time but is noticing that signing up for all these platforms, individually looking for open positions and filling out different applications is taking a lot of time. Student A then finds our website, where he signs up once and finds a plethora of resources. Student A can now make an elevator pitch that distinguishes him from other applicants. Student A sees a job fair being hosted by X-Y-Z on our platform because we have connected him with resources that best match his skill sets and intentions, and so he decides to join. He is impressed by the company which he would previously skipped through, since he had no idea about it. Upon clicking on X-Y-Z company's job opening, he is taken to X-Y-Z company's career site, where the application form is already filled with his information that he provided on our website, while he was applying to other positions. He is ready to apply with his resume and submits his application in just a few minutes. 

Recuiter B receives Student A's application and is impressed by the unique elevator pitch. He is enjoying going through the application and getting a more concrete idea of the applicant. Recruiter B contacts Student A through our platform and schedules a quick video interview for the next day. Recruiter B did not have to open another tab, log in to his email, search for applicant's email, write an email explaining the intent of the email, and attach a zoom link. He simply had to contact the applicant through our website and schedule a video interview thorugh the platform. Student A receives this message and is very relieved that now his interview invites will not be lost in spam and his other verious emails. 

## Principles

**Easy App-ly** is providing both of these users with a more efficient solution to employment search and recruitment through this digital era. Correspondingly, our key principles are: 

- The application must be **simple to navigate** for job seekers, recruiters and non tech-savvy user rather than having too many complicated features
- The application must provide **a sense of community between users** by supporting connections between users
- The application must **save users time**
