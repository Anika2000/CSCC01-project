# Sprint 2 Planning meeting

## Participants, Sprint Goals, Spikes

In our Sprint 2 planning meeting, the group Drop Table Teams (consisting of Jan, Christina, Anika, Jiale, Kourosh, Mohammed, and Raymond) decided that our sprint goal will be to integrate the login feature into the application. As well as start to build our elevator pitch, interview sechduling and user search/system features.
