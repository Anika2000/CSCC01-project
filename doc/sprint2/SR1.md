- Kourosh Jaberi
- Raymond Kiguru
- Christina Ma

### Unfinished tasks and group them into stories:
DTT-54: As a user, I can log-in and automatically be directed to the proper page based on my previous session so that I can access the website from where I left off.

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Have the user stories that are more complex and have more subtasks split amongst multiple team members. 
- To start work early and continue to work on the task regularly. This is so that there is enough time to debug and resolve any issues. 
- Starting work early also allows for team members working on the same user story to help each other when one team member runs into an issue. It also ensures that team members are matching pace and are able to complete their individual tasks on time.
- Continue having our standup meetings every couple days. This helps keep everyone on track and all members updated on everyone else’s progress.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Not to wait until the last two days to merge all code pieces together. This process took many hours as we didn’t anticipate to run into as many merging issues as we did.
- Divide the work to complete the necessary documentation early on. 
- Having branch names without the Jira task number.

### What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 1:
Best: 
- Having a good working product at the end of sprint 1.
- Our demo went smoothly.
- All work was completed with little to no conflicts. Everyone contributed meaningfully and were cooperative. 
- Attendance for all our meetings and standups were perfect.

Worst: 
- The merging of all code took a long time. 
- Completing the required documentation took much longer than expected.
